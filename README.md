# Machine Learning Projects ðŸ¤–

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects completed as part of a **machine learning research class**. Each project was done in a group with **two peers** and involved building models from scratch in Python to solve a general task. Our goal was to not only implement the core algorithms but also to find and apply additional methods for analysis, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and thoroughly documenting our findings. This work aims to provide a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms without relying on high-level libraries.

### Folder Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific machine learning project. The typical structure for a project folder is as follows:

* **`model_name.py`**: The Python script containing the core implementation of the machine learning model.
* **`code.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the process of applying the model to a dataset, analyzing its performance, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
* **`README.md`**: A brief README specific to that model, explaining its purpose and any specific usage notes.

### Projects Included
* **KNN-Decision-Tree**: A project showcasing the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree models.
* **Linear-Logistic-Regression**: A project focused on the foundational Linear and Logistic Regression algorithms.
* **MLP-CNN**: A more advanced project implementing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
* **BERT**: A project applying BERT to AG News with probing, full fine-tuning, and LoRA, achieving up to 92.7% accuracy with attention visualizations for interpretability.
